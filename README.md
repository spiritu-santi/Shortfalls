# Digital Knowledge Shortfalls

Files needed to run the results from:

Ramírez-Barahona S, Cuervo-Robayo AP, Magallón S. 2022. Assessing digital accessible botanical knowledge and priorities for (re)exploration and discovery of plant diversity across Mesoamerica.

- The 'data' directory contains some of the datasets (< 100MB) necessary to conduct the analyses (other data are generated within the script).  
- The 'code' directory contains the R script to perform the analyses and plot the results.  
- The 'figures' direrctory contains output plots generated within the script (NOTE: the final figures were obtained by editing figures in Adobe Illustrator).
- The 'output' directory contains some of the output files (< 100MB) of the code (other outputs are generated within the script).
- The 'interim' directory is empty and intermediate outputs will be saved here.
