# Digital Knowledge Shortfalls

Files needed to run the results from:

Ramírez-Barahona S, Cuervo-Robayo AP, Magallón S. 2022. Assessing digital accessible botanical knowledge and priorities for (re)exploration and discovery of plant diversity across Mesoamerica.

- The data directory contains some of the datasets (< 100MB) necessary to conduct the analyses (other data are generated within the script). 
- The code directory contains the R script to perform the analyses and plot the results (NOTE: the resulting plots were edited in Adobe Illustrator to obtain the final figures).
- The output directory contains some of the output files (< 100MB) of the code (other outputs are generated within the script).
- The interim directory is empty.
